While I may be the millionth person to blog about their OSCP experience, I have the relatively unique perspective of completing both the PWK v1 and PWK v2 content. This gives me intimate familiarity with the changes the course has undergone and whether PWK v1 era advice is still applicable. If not, at least I can look back on this years from now and reflect on the path I’ve taken.\nThe Difference Between PWK v1 and v2 Having both the PWK v1 and v2 materials, I can provide concrete stats on what’s changed:\n 380 to 853 pages (2.24x more pages, and more on each page too!) 102 to 257 questions requiring reporting (2.52x longer) 7:28:35 to 18:07:04 of videos (2.42x longer)  Yes, counting the questions did take me longer than I’d like to admit…\nThe Lab Report As everyone who has undertaken their OSCP knows, there is an optional lab report which can be completed, detailing solutions to the PWK exercises and writeups of at least ten lab machines. If you choose to do this and complete it satisfactorily, then you will be awarded five additional points (at the time of writing), when submitted along with your exam report. Additional points during a challenging exam are a complete no-brainer. Who could ever possibly purposefully handicap themselves by not submitting it?\nMe.\nIf you or I were sitting the exam years ago, then I could recommend it. But given the current state of the course, I see it as a strict disadvantage. Years ago, the lab report was worth ten points and was substantially shorter. With the lab report now only being worth five points and being well over double the length, it’s far less attractive. Add to this the fact that you’re sent your resources at the same time as your lab time begins and it’s just not worth it.\nOnline, I’ve seen people write of how it took them well over a month to complete the lab report. To someone who hasn’t done it themselves, this may sound like nothing more than complaints coming from those unwilling to invest sufficient time. But assuming you have commitments beyond your OSCP (work, family, etc.), I can assure your it’s completely realistic.\nDoes this mean you should skip all of the exercises or potentially the materials entirely? Again, no. It’s a matter of balance. My view is completely based on conjecture and anecdotal evidence, so it should be taken with a grain of salt. But, I think the resources are absolutely invaluable learning tools and skipping them largely defeats the purpose of taking the course. I would, however, draw the line when reporting is taking more time than learning. You don’t need to complete 257 exercise questions to understand the materials and it’s far from the best use of your time.\nIs PWK v2 Worse? No, not at all.\nI wouldn’t want anyone to have that be the takeaway of this post. The course is longer because it’s better. Interesting and important topics such as Active Directory which we’re totally absent from PWK v1 are now given more than adequate coverage. Existing topics were also rewritten and improved. You can read about it directly from Offensive Security here if you’re interested. If you’re doing your OSCP for the sake of the certification alone, then perhaps this is worse for you. But assuming you actually intend to learn and better your skills, PWK v2 is undoubtedly superior.\nTips During my own preparation, I read my fair share of blog posts and forum threads describing the experiences and recommendations of others. Having now come out the other side, I am left with an overwhelming sense that the exam is put on far too large of a pedestal. That’s not to say that it’s not challenging or that you won’t want to rip your hair out at times, but I think many writeups do more harm than good by making the reader feel extraordinarily unprepared. OSCP is an entry-level certification. You do not need to be a master of the dark arts to pass.\nWhile being a fantastic source of tips and guidance, the much beloved Ultimate OSCP Preparation Guide is in my opinion an offender. Yes, if you do everything that the guide prescribes, you will completely blitz the OSCP. You’ll also be comically overprepared. The main issue I take with the guide is that the incredible long list of recommendations it makes sound as though they are mandatory. This is enough to make anyone feel as though they will need to spend every waking moment for the next few years of their life doing nothing but preparing for their OSCP. Or more likely, just give up. Again, the OSCP is an entry-level certification!\nAlthough I’m forbidden from providing any specifics regarding the examination process, by far and away the most common pitfall I ran into was making trivial mistakes, followed by overthinking. I’m reminded of being completely and utterly lost on how a box could be vulnerable. I dug myself deeper and deeper into more and more esoteric attacks because I could just not see how it was possible. In the end what saved me was throwing all my notes away and just starting again. Of course, the solution was comically trivial and it was a careless mistake on my part. One final time, say it with me: entry-level certification!\nYou can do it!\n","wordCount":"902","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-09-11T16:47:00+10:00","dateModified":"2021-09-11T16:47:00+10:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Andrzej Grzeslak"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://agrzeslak.github.io/blog/posts/oscp-and-pwk-in-hindsight/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Andrzej's Site","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://agrzeslak.github.io/blog/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script>
